# Incident Reports  

This repository displays skill showcases for the cybersecurity activity of reporting incidents.  
The prompts and the data logs for these showcases were taken from the [Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate][1]
lab's activities. However, the incident reports were developed and written by the author of this repository.  

### Prompt 1  

An online company who sells recipes and cookbooks has suffered a cyberattack on their website. The criminal published
all website's content online for free access. A team of cybersecurity analysts responded to the incident and gathered
information about the occurrence, the information was then processed and used to generate a report.  

The report can be viewed on the file under the name [Security incident report][report1]. The data used for generating
this report can also be viewed under the name [Traffic log][log].  

### Prompt 2  

A social media company has suffered a data beach which compromised the user's SPII
(*Sensitive Personally Identifiable Information*). The threat actor used as a vector, vulnerabilities within the
organization's network to gain access to the database. After the occurrence, the company decided to perform a security
audit with the goal of hardening the network system and improve the organization's overall security infrastructure.  

The report for this can be viewed under the name [Security risk assessment report][report2].  

### Prompt 3  

An online company who provides web design, graphic design, and social media marketing solutions has recently suffered a
cyberattack on their network system. The threat actor was able to stop the network services by performing a DDoS attack.
The organization was able to recover from the incident. During the process of responding to the problem, information was
gathered and a report was created based on this data. The report follows **NIST's**
(*National Institute of Standards and Technology*) **CSF** (*CyberSecurity Framework*).  

You can view the report under the name [Incident report NIST CSF][report3].
